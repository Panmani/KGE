There are two main approaches that I will try:

1. Use POS and parsing tree to extract possible name entities. It probably involves some prebuilt Libraries/Packages.

2. Train LSTM-RNN/CNN, either at word level or character level.

Issues that might be hard to cope with:
It is very likely that we recognize many name entities that we are not interested in, such as journalist's name, some governor's name, etc.

--- Observations:
1. Works poorly when the organizations's name starts with a number. E.g., 1 Mechanised Division of the Nigerian Army (Result 3.)
2. This model only have lables: PER ORG LOC MISC (MISC is for everything other than the first 3 classes). Therefore, it cannot classify titles, ranks, etc. The dataset is CONLL2003. If we switch to our dataset, it might improve.
